**How it works?**

NewsBerry accesses the NewsAPI and gathers all the data from the API. NewsBerry puts that data through the IBM Watson API in order to get even more cool features about the news and puts it all into its own database. When a user asks NewsBerry a question, it queries the databases and tells the user excatly what the user wants.

**Cool Features**

Are you curious about who the most written-about person is right now? (I think you can get that one right) Do you wish to know more about the entities such as person, location, and companies you care about? NewsBerry automatically sorts the data from the sources, ranks, and then displays the result in visually appealing charts.

With the help of IBM Nautral Language Understanding, NewsBerry is able to read the tone of the articles the world is reading. With a quick function, it displays the sentiments according to IBM NLU of all the recent news.
